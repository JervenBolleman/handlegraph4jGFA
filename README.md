# handlegraph4j gfaXreader

This is a GFA1 parser (assuming only ascii 7-bit input or UTF-8 with all code points being less than 128). 

The code at this point does not support:
* C lines
* Any optional field
* H line contents

There is a skeleton code for GFA2 but nothing practical is written down yet code 
wise. 

Contributions here are super welcome!
